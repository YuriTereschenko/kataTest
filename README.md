This is a calculator that accepts 2 digits from 1 to 10, Roman or Arabic numerals, a mathematical operator (+, -, *, /) in the format "X + Y". Please note that Roman numerals do not take negative values.  

If Roman numerals are passed, the result will be returned in Roman numerals, similarly with Arabic numerals. Expressions where one number is indicated by Roman numerals and the other by Arabic numerals are not allowed. Calculations are performed only with integers. The calculator only works with integers, if the result of the calculation is a floating-point number, the fractional part will simply be discarded (not according to the rules of mathematical rounding)
